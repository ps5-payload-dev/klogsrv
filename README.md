# ps5-payload-klogsrv
This is a simple socket server for jailbroken PS5s that redirects /dev/klog to
sockets connected on port 3232.

## Quick-start
To deploy ps5-payload-klogsrv, first make sure [ps5-payload-elfldr][elfldr] is
running, then load the payload as follows:

```console
john@localhost:~$ export PS5_HOST=ps5
john@localhost:~$ wget -q -O - https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/klogsrv/releases/latest/download/Payload.zip | gunzip -c -d | nc -q0 $PS5_HOST 9021
```

## Usage
To view the raw output of /dev/klog, we can connect to the socket server using
netcat:
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-klogsrv$ export PS5_HOST=ps5
john@localhost:ps5-payload-klogsrv$ nc $PS5_HOST 3232
```
If you like to format or filter the output, have a look at the script: `klogfmt.py`.
For example:
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-klogsrv$ export PS5_HOST=ps5
john@localhost:ps5-payload-klogsrv$ nc $PS5_HOST 3232 | python klogfmt.py
```

## Building
Assuming you have the [ps5-payload-sdk][sdk] installed on a POSIX machine,
ps5-payload-klogsrv can be compiled using the following two commands:
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/klogsrv$ export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/klogsrv$ make
```
